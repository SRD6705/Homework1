			<h1> All About Stephen D</h1>

			<p> Originally from chicago, I moved to NY in 2002 for graduate school. In 2004 I graduated from LIU CW Post with a Masters in Clinical Art Therapy. I was maried in 2010 and in 2011 my wife and I had our first child, Indigo.</p>

				<p> As an artist, I am really intersted in the idea of non-objective elements (familiar shapes and lines) merging or colliding with objective elements, such as familiar building-like structures. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h2> My favorite figuritive painter is, Francis Bacon </h2>
				</li>
					<p> Francis Bacon wasa British painter who had a tremendous amount of tension in his paintings, but formally they were incredibly balanced. </p>
				<li>
					<h2> My favorite non-objective painter is, Wassily Kandinsky </h2>
				</li>
					<p> Wassily Kandinsky was incredibly influential to my work as a painter. </p>
